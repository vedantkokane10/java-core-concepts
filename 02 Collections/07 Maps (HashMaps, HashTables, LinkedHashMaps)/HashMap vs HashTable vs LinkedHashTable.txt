HashMap ->
    -> Not thread-safe (No Synchronization like mutex or lock)
    -> Faster as only it is meant for a single thread use
    -> Allows one null key and multiple null values
    -> Generally faster due to lack of synchronization
    -> Keys are not ordered

LinkedHashMap ->
    -> Maintains elements in insertion order
    -> Not thread-safe (No Synchronization like mutex or lock)
    -> Allows one null key and multiple null values
    -> Slightly slower than HashMap due to the linked list overhead for ordering
    -> its implementation is similar to HashSet (image in Sets)

HashTable ->
    -> Synchronized (thread-safe)
    -> Does not allow null keys or values; throws NullPointerException
    -> Slower due to synchronization
    -> Keys are not ordered
