**** Multi-threading is not a JAVA specific-concept, it is a universal Operating System's core concept, Java only provides APIs to use OS-level threads.

Multitasking in process:
    -> While executing programs, each program create multiple processess for execution of sub-tasks
    -> Each process within a program is independent of each other. They have their own memory, resources etc
    -> Execution of multiple programs at the same time (concurrently) is multitasking in process.
    -> The CPU switches between the different programs (processes) while preserving the context of the process/program
    -> context -> process state, Stack, Registers, Program counter
    -> Ex Writing code in VSCode and switching to Notes App at same time 
    -> we are switiching from VSCode executing process to Notes App process

Multitasking in Threads:
    -> Thread is smallest execution unit of a process
    -> Threads share same memory and resources as they are part of same process
    -> Threads have separate stacks & program counters
    -> Thread switching is faster than process switching.
    -> Ex In a browser on youtube.com we are playing a video and at the same time new videos are loaded (recommendation) that can be played next on sidebar
    -> All threads belong to one browser process.
    -> Thread are 2 types User and Daemon

User Threads:
    -> Created by the Application
    -> JVM waits for them to finish
    -> JVM does NOT exit until all user threads complete
    -> Main() function (public static void main()) is also a user thread

Daemon Threads:
    -> These are background service Threads
    -> JVM does not wait for them to finish their execution
    -> Automatically terminated when all user threads finish
    -> Ex Garbage Collectior, background monitoring thread

Threads in JAVA:
    -> Thread is class which implements the Runnable Interface, the Runnable interface has only 1 abstract function which is run()
    -> The main() method executes in a thread called the main thread
    -> Threads created inside main() are child threads of the main thread
    -> This relationship is logical, not hierarchical in terms of control
    -> The main thread does not control child threads after starting them 
    -> All threads are scheduled independently by the JVM/OS
