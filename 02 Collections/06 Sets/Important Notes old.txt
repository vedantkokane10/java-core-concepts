Insertion Logic
-> When we insert any data in the hashSet/LinkedHashSet it passes that data to hashCode() functionfirst and genrates a key
-> Once a hashed key is generated, a bucket is found 
    -> which is empty in HashSet case
    -> for LinkedHashSet there is linkedlist maintained for values so by default we can add many values to same bucket
-> For Custom DataTypes i.e classes as Data (Ex Student class)
    -> The hash code is memory address
        -> So, Suppose 
        -> Set<Student> s1 = new HashSet<>();
        -> s1.insert(new Student(40, 50));
        -> if we test using s1.contains(new Student(40,50)) -> then this give false
            -> because the memory address would be different for both the objects of Student class even if the data is same 
            -> Set is treating the above 2 objects as different ones
            -> We need to override equals() & hashCode() method for Student class, inorder to avoid duplicate objects with same data
            -> equals() and hashCode() are methods of object Class (Every class by default extends Object class)
            -> all the existing Datatypes like Integer etc already implemented the equalsTo() method
