🔹 Internal Working of Map (Hashtable)
1️⃣ Key is passed to put(key, value)
2️⃣ hashCode() of the key is called
3️⃣ Hash value is processed and bucket index is calculated
4️⃣ Hashtable checks that bucket
    -> If bucket is empty → new entry is inserted
    -> If bucket is not empty → collision occurs
5️⃣ Collision handling
    -> Keys are compared using equals()
    -> If key already exists → value is replaced
    -> If key is different → new node is added
6️⃣ Bucket structure
    -> Uses LinkedList only
❌ No Red-Black Tree optimization
7️⃣ Thread safety
    -> All methods are synchronized
    -> Only one thread can access at a time
8️⃣ Rehashing
    -> Happens when size exceeds threshold
    -> Capacity is increased and entries are rehashed

📌 Notes
❌ Null key not allowed
❌ Null value not allowed
❌ Slower than HashMap
✔ Thread-safe (legacy class)
