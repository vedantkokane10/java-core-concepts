- TreeMap implements NavigavleMap interface which indeed implements the SortedMap interface
- SortedMap interface implements the Map interface
- TreeMap stores keys in a sorted manner
- TreeMap uses balanced trees
- Searching in a HashMap is faster as compare to the TreeMap, as hashing algorithms offer better performance than searching algorithms
- NavigavleMap has navigable functions which are used to find closest matches for specific search targets
- In addition to SortedMap function the NavigavleMap has functions which are analogous to the functions of NavigavleSet
- Functions of NavigavleMa (First/Last entry) -
    -> Map.Entry<K,V> pollFirstEntry()
    -> Map.Entry<K,V> pollLastEntry()
    -> Map.Entry<K,V> firstEntry()
    -> Map.Entry<K,V> lasttEntry()
- Functions of NavigavleMa (Closest key) -
   -> K ceilingKey(K key)
   -> K floorKey(K key)
   -> K higherKey(K key)
   -> K lowerKey(K key)
