🔹 Internal Working of Map (HashMap)
1️⃣ Key is passed to put(key, value)
2️⃣ hashCode() of the key is called
3️⃣ Hash value is processed and bucket index is calculated
4️⃣ HashMap checks that bucket
    -> If bucket is empty → new entry is inserted
    -> If bucket is not empty → collision occurs
5️⃣ Collision handling
    -> Keys are compared using equals()
    -> If key already exists → value is replaced
    -> If key is different → new node is added
6️⃣ Bucket structure
    -> Initially uses a LinkedList
    -> Converted to Red-Black Tree when:
    -> Bucket size > 8
    -> Table size ≥ 64
7️⃣ Rehashing
    -> Happens when size > (capacity × load factor)
    -> Capacity is doubled
    -> All entries are rehashed and redistributed
