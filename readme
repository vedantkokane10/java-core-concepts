📘 Java Core Concepts

This repository contains my notes and practice code for core Java concepts such as OOPs, Collections, Generics, and Multithreading.
I studied these topics mainly from the official Java documentation and converted them into simple, easy-to-understand examples in my own language for quick revision and interview preparation.

This repo focuses on core concepts rather than basic syntax, and is meant to serve as a personal reference as well as a revision guide.
