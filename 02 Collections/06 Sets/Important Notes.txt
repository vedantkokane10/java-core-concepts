Insertion Logic
-> When we insert any data in HashSet / LinkedHashSet
-> Java first calls the hashCode() method on the object
-> hashCode() generates a hash value
-> Using this hash value, a bucket index is calculated

-> If the bucket is empty
    -> The element is inserted directly

-> If the bucket is not empty
    -> Java calls equals() method
    -> If equals() returns true
        -> Duplicate element
        -> New element is NOT added
    -> If equals() returns false
        -> Collision occurs
        -> Element is added to the same bucket

-> HashSet
    -> Does NOT maintain insertion order

-> LinkedHashSet
    -> Maintains insertion order
    -> Internally uses a doubly linked list
    -> Does NOT allow duplicate elements

-> For Custom Data Types (Example: Student class)
    -> If equals() and hashCode() are NOT overridden
        -> hashCode() is generated using memory address
        -> equals() compares references (==)

-> Example
    -> Set<Student> s1 = new HashSet<>();
    -> s1.add(new Student(40, 50));
    -> s1.contains(new Student(40, 50)) -> false

-> Reason
    -> Two different objects are created
    -> Memory addresses are different
    -> HashSet treats both objects as different

-> Solution
    -> Override equals() method
    -> Override hashCode() method
    -> Objects with same data are treated as equal
    -> Duplicate objects are avoided

-> equals() and hashCode()
    -> Belong to Object class
    -> Every class by default extends Object

-> Built-in Wrapper Classes
    -> Integer
    -> String
    -> Double
    -> Boolean
    -> These classes already override equals() and hashCode()

-> Important Rule
    -> If two objects are equal using equals()
        -> They MUST return the same hashCode()
